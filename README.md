# Cuphead

Game Cuphead by Yulia Kunts.

I wrote a game, which was created and inspired by the game "Cuphead", namely the Hilda Berg level. The goal of the game is to defeat Hilda.

The game has settings that are saved between outputs: adjusting the music (turn on/off), changing the background of the game. It can be paused. After that, a window pops up with the following options: continue the game, return to the menu, exit the game. If you lose or win, a window pops up with the following options: replay, return to the menu, exit the game.

When you start playing, in the upper left corner you will see the amount of boss health and the number of your lives. You can get 20, 4 and 2 points of damage from enemies. Every 60 points of damage reduces the number of your lives by one. And most importanly, don't touch your enemies.

Good luck :)
