# Cuphead

Game Cuphead by Yulia Kunts.

This game was created and inspired by the game "Cuphead", namely the Hilda Berg level.

There is a guide in a game, with which you can study in detail how the movement works. Also, when you click on "Shift", the hero will accelerate. The attack happens automatically. The goal of the game is to defeat Hilda Berg. In achieving your goal, Hilda herselfand her friends enemies.

When you start playing, in the upper left corner you will see the amount of boss health and the number of your lives. You can get 20, 4 and 2 points of damage from enemies.Every 60 points of damage reduces the number of your lives by one. And most importanly, don't touch your enemies.

Good luck :)
